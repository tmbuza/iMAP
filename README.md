## Original iMAP!

### Running Analysis within Docker Container (Default)
* See this [Docker README](https://github.com/tmbuza/iMAP/blob/master/README0.md) for step-by-step instructions.
	* Requires Docker Images and Docker containers CLI.
	* Uses fewer resources, but memory-intensive computing may sometimes fail.
	* All analyses are run interactively on the container's Command-line.
	* The iMAP folder is, by default, the working directory and is readable from the container.
	* The output is stored in the working directory, which means it can be accessed outside the container.
* Important: Graphical applications don't work well in Docker containers. 
* Some R-packages installed perfectly in RStudio may not install correctly in docker images.


### Running Analysis On Specific Platforms
* See [Original README](https://github.com/tmbuza/iMAP/blob/master/_README.md) for step-by-step instructions.
* This README is a work in progress. Please visit this page regularly for more updates.
* No Docker images are required.
* May probably require manual installation of some tools.
* Uses RStudio to install required R-packages.
